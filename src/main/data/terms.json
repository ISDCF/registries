Older and cheaper models are generally only suitable for calibrating xenon arc-illuminated projectors, as their bandwidth sensitivity is not sufficient for use with laser light sources.  A photoradiometer differs from a light meter in that it can measure both color temperature and light levels: a light meter can only measure the latter.",

    "definition": "Categories that refer to the hardware architecture of DCI-compliant digital cinema projectors.  Series 1 projectors were manufactured between approximately 2006 and 2011, and were the first generation to be capable of DCI compliance.  They are 2K only, and include three image processing boards manufactured by Texas Instruments.  They can only be used with an external media block, connected by HD-SDI.  Spare parts support for Series 1 projectors has now ceased, though a small number remain in revenue earning service.  Series 2 projectors were manufactured between approximately 2010 and 2020, can be 2K or 4K, contain a single TI image processing board, the Integrated Cinema Processor (ICP), and can be used with either an external or an integrated media block.  Most Series 2 models are still actively supported by their manufacturers.  In Series 3 and later projectors, only the Digital Micromirror Array (DMD) chips are actually manufactured by Texas Instruments: the other image processing hardware is made by the projector manufacturer.  Series 3 (Barco and Christie) and Series 4 (Barco) are essentially marketing labels as distinct from systems of TI image processing board infrastructure.",

It is sometimes possible to 'unstick' pixels by playing rapidly alternating black and white test patterns for an extended period, but this fault usually requires replacement of the entire light engine to resolve.",
